Compress CSS â€“ Online CSS Minifier
=========================================================

CompressCSS is a free tool that you can use to minify your CSS files online.
Smaller file size means less bandwidth consumption, so by compressing you're
not only saving up money on hosting but you're also making your site load faster.

How does it work?
--------
It works by removing unnecessary white-spaces, line breaks, indentations, comments, semicolons, quotes and by combining rules when possible. It can also optimize various properties, like converting rgb colors to shorthand hex equivalent resulting into shorter code. By the default, the compressor also removes all invalid CSS such as negative paddings and empty rules. These are just a few among many things that this tool can do.
